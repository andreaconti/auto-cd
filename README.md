# Auto-cd

I find really useful while working on a project to open many shells in the same
folder and is really annoying for each of them to `cd` in that folder, even 
using the awesome `z` plugin.

`auto-cd` simply remembers the last `cd` you have done and when you will open a
new shell it will automatically `cd` into it.

## Install

- manual installation 

```zsh
curl -L https://github.com/andreaconti/auto-cd > /path/to/auto-cd.zsh

```
